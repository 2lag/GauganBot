# GauganBot
A WIP Twitter/Instagram bot that posts AI generated art from NVIDIA's Gaugan2 application.
(First 200 pictures were generated using a random generated list of 180 adjective and 10 nouns, entering them as the only method of image generation)
(For the remaining pictures, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2lag/GauganBot/main/randomColors.pde](url)this was used for generating segmentation maps, that would then  be uploaded to Gaugan2, creating the final product)
