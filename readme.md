# GauganBot
A WIP Twitter/Instagram bot that posts AI generated art from [NVIDIA's Gaugan2 application.](http://gaugan.org/gaugan2/)

 -First 200 pictures were generated using a random generated list of 180 adjective and 10 nouns, found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2lag/GauganBot/main/comboList.txt) entering them as the only method of image generation
 

 ~~-For the remaining 165 pictures, [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2lag/GauganBot/main/randomColors.pde) was used for generating segmentation maps, that would then be uploaded to Gaugan2, creating the final product~~
  ###### This ended up not working within the Gaugan2 application for some reason, it was worth a shot though! Ended up using first method for all 365 photos. (365/365 generated so far, 100% done!)

 
 All images can be found [here.](https://github.com/2lag/GauganBot/tree/main/pics)
